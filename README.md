# Restaurant Website

I am designing a restaurant website that allow user to navigate through several web pages, access links, and make a reservation system.


## About the reservation system
- There is a total of 12 tables: 4 2-seater, 4 4-seater, and 4 6-seater
- The form will required a name, phone number, number of guests, date, and time of arrival
- A table will be selected based on the party size
- Some available time options within one hour (before and after) of choosen time will be shown
- If there are no empty timeslots around the interval, the reservtion system will look for the next available table, choosing a bigger table if required
- A message will be shown if no tables are available
- Otherwise, the user will be able to select a timeslot and make a 2-hour reservations with their name and phone number saved
